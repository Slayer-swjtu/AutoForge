I have an idea to combine tools such as LLVM, Clang, KLEE, Google Test (gtest), and Doxygen to build an automated tool, 
for generating, assembling, and verifying test cases for large-scale C++ source code. 
Perhaps it will be integrated with GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer),  
enhancing the test coverage rate for various projects and mitigating code risks as well.
